# LR_music_slider_app (code only)



This is an small GUI app that helps in control the music volume of LIGHTNING RETURNS FINAL FANTASY XIII steam version.

You can download already compiled builds of this app from the releases page and that would include everything neccessary for this app to work for your game.


The app is made with Python and the .py file can be opened in your python code editor with which you can edit the code yourself and make a better version of this app if you want to do so. make sure to install the neccessary python packages into your editor and you can then compile it to a exe file with pyinstaller. 

This repo only has the project code and I have not included the batch scripts and the modified game files which are neccessary for setting the music volume of the game. You can get those files from the already compiled builds in the release section.
