# LR Music Slider (app code only)



This is an small python GUI app that helps in controlling the music volume of LIGHTNING RETURNS FINAL FANTASY XIII steam version.

You can download already compiled builds of this app from my mod page on nexus. that includes everything neccessary for this app to work for your game.


I used pycharm as my code editor and the .py file can be opened in your desired python code editor with which you can edit the code and make a better looking version of this app if you want to do so. 
make sure to install the neccessary python packages into your editor and you can then compile it to a exe file with pyinstaller. 


This repo only has the project code and I have not included the batch scripts and the modified game files which are neccessary for setting the music volume of the game.
